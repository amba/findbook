findbook: a simple script to find and view ebooks (and other content) on your
hard drive.
For a regular expression or fixed substring given on the commandline,
findbook will search through the filenames in a preconfigured list of
directories.
The list of directories and the mapping of file formats to viewer programs
is specified in a handy YAML configuration file.

INSTALL

install with one of
$ apt-get install perl-libyaml-libyaml
$ yum install perl-YAML-LibYAML
$ cpanm YAML::XS 

USAGE

Type ./findbook --help to get a list of commandline options.

CONFIGURATION

You need a configuration file with contents like this:
-------------- ~/.config/findbook.yml --------------------

# 'formats' hash (see below) is not given
